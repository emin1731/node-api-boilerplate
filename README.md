# ExpressJs simple API using IoT and DP 

This repository demonstrates a simple API implementation using Node.js and Express.js. 
It leverages Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) to enhance modularity and maintainability. 
The API utilizes Prisma ORM for efficient database interactions, ensuring seamless data management. 
Additionally, it employs OOP approach instead of functional, promoting organized and scalable code architecture. 
This project was created thanks to the AlariCode tutorials.
